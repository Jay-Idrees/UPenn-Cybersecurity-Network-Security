I created this repository to capture things I learned on the topic of network security during my certification training at the University of Pensylvania

## Network Security

- **Request and Response Method**
Two-way convrsation b/w client and the server

- **LAN Benifits** Security, speend and performance, easy to add devices

- **WAN** Many LANs connected together, benifit- Able to share resources over a much larger geographic area. Disadvantages- needs encryption for data exchange from LAN to WAN and difficult trouble shooting if outside the LAN- Traffic issues


## Topologies

- **Ring** Can be Uni/Bidirectional, every device is the point of failure, can have slow speed/latency. But there is no central node data manager

- **Linear** Every device is a point of failure, same latency issues

- **Star** Has a centeral node, if that goes down the network goes down but if the a divice fails- that does not affect the network- Easy to extend the network- Distance b/w the central node and the device matter

- **Bus** Fast but wastes brandwith to all the devices equally, two devices cannot transmit data simultaneously

- **Tree** All devices below the the top computer get disconnected from the network 

**Fully connected** All devices are connected with eachother- very complicated to setup, very difficult to add a device as will require so many connections

**Mesh** Only a subset of the computers are fully connected 

**Hybrid** Combination of above- Most modern networks are hybrid
